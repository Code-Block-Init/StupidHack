Better do abortion if you hate a female child,
Why?
Atleast, that female baby's life will be saved before instead of spending whole life with pain.

I am stuck at present & my future is in shit.
And i hate college,
Also, I have nobody to even socialize 'in real'.
After i woke up, I was trying to have conversation with mom today specially asking "Did you eat something?" with care,
She just yelled at me only talking about her only and her lovely son sufferings only saying that i am disturbing her.
1 hour wasted => Nearly 3600 seconds wasted.
Dad also don't call me a lot.
And i also hate when someone hurts my parents,
I've care for them because they are growing old,
But in return, they ...........
I told her:- Just pray to God that i must go very far from you again and live very happily faraway.

Not only today, Even 'when my parents were young, they did the same to me during that period too',
Sadly, i was unlucky that i am ended up like this...

If I'd to write my problems as well as how i manage them,
Then I'd to write a book.

Oh Oh, Why are parents wanting to have a female child if they are so .....?
