This is so funny,
Because I had never been this much sad in my whole life.

2013 and 2014 gave me worst blow ever,
Especially 2014 was more like death.

What makes me angry is...
The cruel sluts who are behind it... they are so happy.

I've been pushed into deep sadness for more than 2 years,
Ah... I've been suffering since childhood..
I've no happy memories to share.

Few memories were in my mobile & wallet that got stolen,
which made me hate that college even more & more.

I am laughing now...
Because, i never cursed them..
I don't curse anybody,
And you know why?
Because I've seen in my own eyes how those people & their families got ruined,
So, i don't need to curse,
Since they automatically get what they deserve.

But, I am so sad...

So..

Currently, along with other core projects, i am doing a secret plan,
I am learning so many degrees by downloading their syllabus,
It might take years i guess,
But i hope to learn faster, though it's too dry,
And the secret plan is...
I want to leave this planet.
It's fun while flying from the bottom of the earth to outer layer,
And then, no gravity,
Then, i die.
But, i will die happily outside this cruel planet without any air/water/noise pollution,
And with peace, without these evil humans. =P
